CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER title_length_check
BEFORE INSERT ON Sneakers
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
  title_length EXCEPTION;
BEGIN
  IF LENGTH(:new.model) < 5 THEN
    RAISE title_length;
  END IF;
EXCEPTION
  WHEN title_length THEN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Title must be at least 5 characters long');
END;


This trigger is fired before each insertion into the Sneakers table and checks if the length of the model column is less than 5 characters. If the length is less than 5 characters, it raises the title_length exception, which is then caught and raises an APPLICATION_ERROR with the message "Title must be at least 5 characters long". This will prevent the insertion of records with titles less than 5 characters long.



We can check if the trigger is working properly by trying to insert a record into the Sneakers table with a model value of less than 5 characters:

INSERT INTO Sneakers (sneaker_id, brand, model, sizes, color, price, description, manufacturer_id)
VALUES (1, 'Nike', 'Air', 9.5, 'Red', 100, 'Comfortable shoes', 1);
