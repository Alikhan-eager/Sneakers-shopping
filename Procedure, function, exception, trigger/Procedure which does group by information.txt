A procedure that groups sneakers by brand and returns the total number of sneakers for each brand:

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE get_sneaker_counts_by_brand(
  p_brand IN VARCHAR2,
  p_cursor OUT SYS_REFCURSOR
) AS
  v_brand VARCHAR2(50);
  v_count NUMBER(10);
BEGIN
  SELECT brand, COUNT(*) AS count
  INTO v_brand, v_count
  FROM Sneakers
  WHERE brand = p_brand
  GROUP BY brand;

  OPEN p_cursor FOR
    SELECT v_brand AS brand, v_count AS count
    FROM DUAL;
END;

This procedure takes a brand name as input and returns a cursor with one row that shows the brand name and the total number of sneakers for that brand. You can call the procedure like this:

DECLARE
  v_cursor SYS_REFCURSOR;
BEGIN
  get_sneaker_counts_by_brand('Nike', v_cursor);
  -- do something with the cursor
END;
