This function takes a table name as input and returns the count of records in that table. It uses dynamic SQL to construct a SELECT statement that counts the rows in the specified table, and then executes that statement using the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement. The count is then returned by the function.

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION count_records(table_name IN VARCHAR2) RETURN NUMBER IS
  num_records NUMBER;
BEGIN
  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ' || table_name INTO num_records;
  RETURN num_records;
END;



We can also use a previously defined function for our tables. Here is an example of how to use the count_records function to count the number of records in each of your tables:


SELECT count_records('Sneakers') as sneaker_count FROM dual;
SELECT count_records('Manufacturer') as manufacturer_count FROM dual;
SELECT count_records('Customers') as customer_count FROM dual;
SELECT count_records('Orders') as order_count FROM dual;
SELECT count_records('Payment_Method') as payment_method_count FROM dual;
SELECT count_records('Shipping') as shipping_count FROM dual;
SELECT count_records('Fulfillment_Center') as fulfillment_center_count FROM dual;
SELECT count_records('Return') as return_count FROM dual;


Each of these queries will return the number of records in the specified table. We can replace the table name in each query to get the count for another table.
